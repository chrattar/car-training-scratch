# ML Agent from Scratch

My saga to develop an ML agent has been quite intense.

Attmepting to use Box2D with pygame.

* Added logging. Need to log maximum and minimum (x,y) values to see what the reward is for what location. It seems that it is hard for the car to get out of the bottom area of the track. i obviously need to change my reward structure to compensate for this.

* Alter the reward structure for going clockwise as opposed to anti-clockwise
